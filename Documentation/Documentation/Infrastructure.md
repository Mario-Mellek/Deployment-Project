## Application Infrastructure

The Application uses AWS services as follows:

- Amazon RDS: hosting a postgresql database to save and provide data to the app.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: used for deploying applications which orchestrates various AWS services, including S3.
- AWS S3 Bucket: used to host the static front-end website that the users interact with.
